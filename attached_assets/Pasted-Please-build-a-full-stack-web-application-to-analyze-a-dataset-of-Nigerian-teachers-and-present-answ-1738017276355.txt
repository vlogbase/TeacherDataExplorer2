Please build a full-stack web application to analyze a dataset of Nigerian teachers and present answers to the listed 73 questions in a visual format (charts/graphs). Below are the requirements and architecture guidelines:

1. Tech Stack
Backend

Node.js + Express for creating RESTful API endpoints.
Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store and query teacher data.
For database interaction, use an ORM such as Sequelize or TypeORM.
Use a CSV parsing library (e.g., fast-csv) to import the teacher data from CSV.
Data Processing

(Optional) For advanced data cleaning or aggregation, you can integrate Python scripts (Pandas) before loading data into the DB. Otherwise, do simpler calculations via SQL queries or JavaScript.
Frontend

React for the front-end UI.
A charting library, such as Chart.js, Recharts, or Victory, for creating interactive charts.
A design framework, e.g. Material-UI (MUI) or Bootstrap, to ensure a clean, responsive layout.
2. Data Model & Endpoints
Database Schema

Store each teacher’s details (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Gender, LGA, etc.) in a teachers table.
Additional tables if needed (e.g. for teacher qualifications, schools, multi-option answers).
API Routes

GET /api/teachers: Returns a list of teachers (possibly with pagination).
GET /api/charts/...: For each question below, create an endpoint that returns the aggregated data needed to plot a chart (counts by gender, LGA, qualification type, etc.).
Examples:

GET /api/charts/teachers-by-gender → returns { male: X, female: Y, other: Z }.
GET /api/charts/teachers-by-lga → returns an array of objects like [ { lga: 'X', count: 25 }, { lga: 'Y', count: 40 }, ... ].
3. Front-End Structure
Dashboard Page

A grid or list of 73 buttons, each labeled according to the question (e.g., “Number of teachers by LGA,” “State of Origin by Gender,” etc.).
When a button is clicked, the front-end makes an API call (e.g., fetch('/api/charts/teachers-by-lga')).
Parse the returned JSON and display it in a chart (bar chart, pie chart, or whichever is most appropriate).
If you want to group questions (e.g., “General Analysis,” “Teacher Background,” etc.), you can organize them into collapsible sections or a sidebar menu.
Chart Components

A generic <ChartDisplay /> React component that accepts data + chart type as props and renders the appropriate chart.
Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<ChartDisplay 
  chartType="Bar" 
  data={dataFromApi} 
  xKey="lga" 
  yKey="count"
  title="Number of Teachers by LGA" 
/>
UI/UX Best Practices

Use a library like Material-UI or Bootstrap for responsive grid layouts and styled buttons.
Ensure each chart has clear labels, legends, and tooltips to make data easy to interpret.
4. Implementation Steps
Setup & Configuration

Initialize a Node.js project (npm init), install Express, Sequelize (or TypeORM), pg (PostgreSQL driver), fast-csv, etc.
Create a React app (create-react-app) or use Vite if you prefer.
Database & Models

Create a Teacher model with fields like:
js
Copy
Edit
{
  firstName: DataTypes.STRING,
  lastName: DataTypes.STRING,
  // ...
  nin: DataTypes.STRING,
  // ...
  gender: DataTypes.ENUM('Male','Female','Other'),
  stateOfOrigin: DataTypes.STRING,
  lga: DataTypes.STRING,
  // ...
}
Run migrations or synchronize models with your Postgres DB.
CSV Import

Write a script (e.g. scripts/importTeachers.js) that uses fast-csv to parse the CSV file, then creates teacher records in the database. Example:
js
Copy
Edit
fs.createReadStream('teachers.csv')
  .pipe(csvParser({ headers: true }))
  .on('data', async (row) => {
    await Teacher.create(row);
  });
API Endpoints

For each question in the list (1–73), decide on the grouping or direct approach. For instance:
js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/api/charts/teachers-by-lga', async (req, res) => {
  const results = await Teacher.findAll({
    attributes: ['lga', [Sequelize.fn('COUNT', Sequelize.col('id')), 'count']],
    group: ['lga']
  });
  res.json(results);
});
Repeat for other queries, adjusting the group/filter logic as needed.
Front-End Components

Create a QuestionsList.jsx that maps over the 73 questions. For each question, display a button.
When the user clicks a button, call the relevant endpoint, fetch the data, and display it in a <ChartDisplay /> component.
Charts

In React, install Chart.js or Recharts. For example, with Chart.js:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js
Implement <ChartDisplay />:
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

function ChartDisplay({ data }) {
  const chartData = {
    labels: data.map(item => item.lga),
    datasets: [{
      label: '# of Teachers',
      data: data.map(item => item.count),
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,0.4)',
    }],
  };
  return <Bar data={chartData} />;
}

export default ChartDisplay;
Adjust as needed for pie, line, or other chart types.
Testing & Deployment

Verify queries return correct data (use test data or automated tests).
Deploy the API (e.g., to Heroku/AWS), and the React app (e.g., Netlify/Vercel).
Ensure environment variables for DB credentials, etc., are secure.
5. Answering the 73 Questions
For each item (1–73) in the “LIST OF DATA TABLES,” do the following:

Create a dedicated endpoint that returns the aggregated data needed to produce the chart. Example:

Question #4: “Number of teachers by LGA”
Endpoint: /api/charts/teachers-by-lga
Query: SELECT lga, COUNT(*) AS count FROM teachers GROUP BY lga;
Return JSON, e.g.:
json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "lga": "Chanchaga", "count": 12 },
  { "lga": "Gurara", "count": 5 },
  ...
]
In React, create a button labeled Number of teachers by LGA. When clicked, call the endpoint and visualize the returned data in a bar chart.

Repeat for each question, modifying the endpoint’s query to match the grouping criteria (by gender, by qualification, etc.). Use additional tables or columns if needed (e.g., “children in teacher household”).

Free-Text Fields (like #66 “Additional training needed”) can be handled either by:

Displaying them in a table or
Creating word clouds or other textual analyses, if desired.
6. Final Notes
Make sure each chart or table has clear labels, axis titles, and a short description.
Group related questions into sections (General Analysis, Teacher Background, etc.) for better UX.
Implement search/filter features if needed (e.g., filtering by state or LGA).
Provide an export option if you want users to download charts or data (e.g., react-to-print or PDF generation with jspdf).
